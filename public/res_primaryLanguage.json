      "description": "Hi, I'm Josh — a front-end developer with full-stack experience, specializing in JavaScript, React, and modern web technologies. I'm currently pursuing my bachelor's degree while working full-time and managing a few freelance clients, where I've built and maintained custom websites from the ground up.\n\nBefore moving into tech, I spent nearly a decade in the Air Force working in aerospace maintenance. That background gave me a strong foundation in problem-solving, attention to detail, and teamwork — qualities that translate directly into how I approach software development.\n\nI'm passionate about creating intuitive, accessible, and visually engaging user experiences while also understanding how the back end supports seamless functionality. I thrive on continuous learning and take pride in turning complex problems into clean, efficient solutions.",
